# RotMG Discord Bot

### Instructions:

* Write ``cd <filename>`` in terminal.
* Write ``npm install`` in your terminal.
* Set your token in Index.js
* Write ``node .`` in terminal to start bot. 


### Note:

* I am assuming you know how to set up bots, so I am not going to cover other stuff. Just look up a tutorial if you don't know how to set up a Discord bot.
* This bot is written in Java.
